# Bank Churn Analysis and Loan Prediction -CrediPlus


Financial institutions face two major risks that significantly impact their long-term profitability and sustainability: customer churn and loan defaults. Customer churn leads
to a decline in customer lifetime value and increases customer acquisition costs, making
retention a critical focus area. Loan defaults, on the other hand, result in direct financial
losses and negatively affect the institutionâ€™s credit stability.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning to address critical
business challenges in the banking domain, starting with customer churn prediction. The
project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing demographic, transactional, and
sentiment-related features, thereby enabling proactive customer retention strategies. In
addition, it seeks to predict loan default based on customer profiles and financial behavior
to support better credit risk assessment.
